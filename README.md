# Sound Made for Listening Community Resources
This is a list of recommended resources for the Sound Made for Listening community Discord. There are a few categories of resources that we have lists for thus far, which are as follows.

*Note: This is a brand new list. It is woefully incomplete at present. Additionally, some of the items in this list have descriptions attached to them. Others don't. The plan is to add descriptions to all of them at some point.*

*When making changes to this list, please try to keep items on the lists in alphabetical order, this index page notwithstanding.*
