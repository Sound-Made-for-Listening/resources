# DAWs
A list of DAWs that are recommended by the Sound Made for Listening community.

### Free
* [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) - technically not free, but runs indefinitely without paying. Highly customizable DAW with a large user community. *Support the developer and purchase a license if you use it for an extended period of time.*

### Paid
* [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) - known for its Session View and live looping capabilities. Cycling '74 Max is built into it, allowing you to create patches and devices that run directly in Live.
* [Bitwig] - resembles Ableton Live in many ways. Known for The Grid, a built-in modular environment that allows you to create custom instruments and effects. Offers a Linux version.
* [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/) - probably the most advanced tracker-oriented DAW available at present. Offers a Linux version and will even run on ARM devices like the Raspberry Pi.
